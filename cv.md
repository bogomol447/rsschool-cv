## *About Myself*
#### <p>I have always been interested in such things as design, art, etc., and I was also attracted and very interested in such an area as IT.

## *Code example:*
#### The main idea here is to reverse the string. If the “reverse” string is completely identical to the original one, then we have received a palindrome and the function should return true. If not, false.
```
const palindrome = str => {
  str = str.toLowerCase()
  return str === str.split('').reverse().join('')
}
```
